## Cursors

We created two custom cursors, each in 3 color variations for the players to use during their turn.

## Icons

We created two custom icons which are used on the Leaderboard/History page: A rocket blasting off for a win, and a rocket crashing for a loss. But these could also be replaced by dots or other markers to represent previous game results.
